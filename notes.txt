- what data types should be used for internal state?
    - pulumi seems limited here - no network types, enums?, ???
    - needs to be efficient - lots of config data
- need to create wrappers for all used API calls
    - can't let the messiness spread

implementation list:
- service (a.k.a. port) groups
- firewall config module
    - rules
- profiles
- edges

long term:
- provide component resources
    - topology-level
    - get around firewall rule limitations
        - can only match single source/destination
        - codegen the required rules
